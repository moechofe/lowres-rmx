* First Steps *
***************

To run a program, just open the LowRes NX application and drag and
drop any .nx file into its window. You can also select LowRes NX as
default application for .nx files, so programs can be started simply
by double clicking them.

For writing your own programs, use any text editor and save your files
with the .nx extension. On Windows make sure the text editor supports
Mac/Linux line ends, otherwise you may see everything in one line.

If you open NX tools (Character Designer, Background Designer, etc.)
directly like other NX programs, they will use the "Disk.nx" file in
your programs folder for loading and saving their data.

To edit your program's data directly (without the "Disk.nx" file),
run your program in the normal way. Then press Ctrl+M to enter the
Development Menu. There click on "ED" and select a tool. It will use
the current program for its data. When done, press Ctrl+M again to
return to the Development Menu, or Ctrl-R to run your program
directly.
